# Active-Directory

These are the scripts that I use to help maintain Active Directory environments that I'm responsible for or scripts I have written to help automate tasks that I'm willing to share.

## Domain Controller Health Check
- Powershellbros.com DC Health E-mail Report (https://www.powershellbros.com/basic-dc-health-email-report-via-powershell/)

## Change AD User Attributes by OU
- This was a script that I wrote in order to make sure all properties on user objects were filled out to sync the user objects up to Azure AD
